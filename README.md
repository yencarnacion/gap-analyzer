## ðŸ§® How the gap is calculated

**Definition:**  
> `Gap% = ( Open_today_09:30 - Close_prior_session ) / Close_prior_session * 100`

In code (`main.go â†’ analyzeGaps`):

```go
prevClose := prev.C  // prior day official RTH close (â‰ˆ16:00 ET)
open      := day.O   // current day official RTH open (â‰ˆ09:30 ET)
gapPct    := (open - prevClose) / prevClose * 100
